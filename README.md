# FlySafe

![FlySafe](/resources/flysafe-cover.png?raw=true"FlySafe")

## Project Description

While travelling, there are many important items necessary to keep track of securely. We want to come up with a better solution to juggling crucial physical documents while on the go.

Your personal information can be accessed remotely with a facial recognition scan. Additionally, the app allows you to quickly find pertinent locations on the move including hotels, airports, hospitals, and embassies. Finally, the currency tool allows the user to quickly view relevant currency information.

Also with an inbuilt document scanning, the app is able to obtain important information and store documents through scans as compared to user input.

**Core Features** - Face Recognition, Currency Information, Nearby important locations(hospitals etc.), Id Scanning

**Swift 5** - iOS app

**Microsoft Azure** - Face Recognition

**Maps** - Showcase nearby important locations 

**XE Server, Alamofire** - get relevant currency information

**BlinkID** - Document Scanning

**Sketch** - Design

## Challenges we ran into

**BlockChain** - incorporating solidity blockchain framework into the iOS framework

## What's next for FlySafe

**Android** - increase user base

**Text Messaging** - allowing user to access information without internet
