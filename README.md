## Project Description

While travelling, there are many important items necessary to keep track of securely. We want to come up with a better solution to juggling crucial physical documents while on the go.

Your personal information can be accessed remotely with a facial recognition scan. Additionally, the app allows you to quickly find pertinent locations on the move including hotels, airports, hospitals, and embassies. Finally, the currency tool allows the user to quickly view relevant currency information.
